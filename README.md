NAME:

myCSA -- the customer and farmer connection application

DESCRIPTION: 

This app allows both Community Supported Agriculture businesses(CSA) and Customers to create profiles to connect with each other. CSAs can post information about produce they offer, as well as location and contact information. Customers can browse through those profiles and find the CSA that matches thier needs and connect with them. 

    ---background:
    As of the time of this writing, there is no centralized place for CSAs to connect with customers. Most farmers do not have the time or know-how to create a compelling online presence through a personal website. Likewise, searching for CSAs in a given area can be tricky for customers, as there is not a centralized, curated list available with easy-to-access information. myCSA solves this. 

SUPPORT:

Email the developer at jonathanrsieg@gmail.com for support. 

ROADMAP:

Future releases will allow much more customization in the profile for CSAs. Additionally, an in-app messaging system and alter system will be created to allow customers and CSA to communicate directly in the app, as well as provide alerts for produce deliveries.

This application is licenced as "Free and Open Source Software."
